# Snakegame
This repository contains a simple Snake Game implemented in C, using the ncurses.h library. The game runs in the terminal and features classic gameplay where the snake grows longer as it eats food, represented by the character '@'. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls or the snake itself. To run the game, simply execute ./fifers in the terminal. If you wish to change this, modify the TARGET in the Makefile to whatever name you prefer. If you'd like to change the table dimensions, you can access the "snakegame.h" file and adjust the ROWS and COLS values.
